# BetterLeads

A mod that allows you to use leads on more entities.

Currently, works with Merchant Entities (Villagers and Wandering Traders), most Hostile Mobs, Water Creatures (fish and
squid), turtles and pandas, you can configure which of these categories are enabled through ModMenu.

The Mobs which it doesn't work properly with are:

- Phantoms
- Ghasts
- Slimes
- Magma-cubes
- Shulkers
- Vexs
- and Bats
