# Leads

A mod which allows you to use leads on more entities.

Currently works with Merchant Entities (Villagers and Wandering Traders), most Hostile Mobs and Water Creatures (fish
and squid), you can configure which of these categories are enabled through ModMenu.

The Hostile Mobs which it doesn't work properly with are:

- Phantoms
- Ghasts
- Slimes
- Magma-cubes
- and Shulkers

Endermen also detach the lead when they teleport.
